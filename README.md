Debunked Assumptions 

I used to think that storing an element id in a variable and positioning the expression at the top of the .js document meant js has access to the variable and its corresponding value.
However, access to the element Id depends on when the element showed up. New assumption: Because elements are primarily introduced in the html, the linked js file has knowledge of those element ids.
